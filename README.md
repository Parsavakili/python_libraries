# pandas :
Pandas is a powerful and widely-used Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data, including:

Series: A one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type.

DataFrame: A two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and is particularly well-suited for working with tabular data, such as data stored in CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or SQL databases.

Key Features of Pandas:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, filter data, and remove duplicates.

Data Transformation: Reshape, merge, and pivot data.

Data Analysis: Perform statistical operations, group data, and aggregate data.

Data Visualization: Integrate with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.

# numpy :
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a fundamental library in Python for scientific computing and data analysis. It provides support for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is the foundation for many other libraries in the Python data science ecosystem, such as Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
